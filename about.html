                <h1>Many more Happy Returns of the day</h1>
                <p>My technical field concerns mostly in areas of data analysis and machine learning programming. I am well aware of js for web development. During my master studies, I found myself exposed to a lot of tools and worked with most of them listed under my skills section. I am very passionate about traveling and event management.
                    I am currently working on two projects: Fact verification System and Colbert.ai
                    I am looking for a thesis opening and would love to work with engaging new topics.
                </p>

<!--                <p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused-->
<!--                    communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application-->
<!--                    according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly-->
<!--                    with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.</p>-->
